# Awesome Programming Games
## An ultra mega giga curated list of programming games

(N.b.: only *readily playable* games will be included here. This means that
original code is available (as well as a separate emulator if needed), or one
or more reimplementations, or both. Examples such as
[Struggle](https://pages.lip6.fr/Christian.Queinnec/WWW/Concurrency.html) are
all well and good but are excluded by this criterion. Additionally there have
to be at least some scraps of documentation. This would appear to exclude a
game like ['bot](https://corewar.co.uk/bot.htm).)
